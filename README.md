This is the design for Murder Ink that was not chosen.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is the version of the Murder Ink site that was the concept for what later became the final Murder Ink site. I collaborated with the client to decide what kind of colors they would like and used this site for inspiration to create something that they really loved. This site is important for showing what the before and after would look like when it comes to creating a project with someone else's input as you go. Communication was key in creating something that they were truly happy with, and I'm glad that I have this project to show the progress.

## Optimizations

**You can see the final product here:** https://hazelwize.github.io/murderInk/

## Lessons Learned:

This project is just here to show how I can take ideas from others and merge it into a viable end product. I enjoy working with others, and the final site wouldn't be here if it weren't for the collaboration between myself and the team. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
